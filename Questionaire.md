# Questionaire

Hey there,

For my senior project I am building a minimalistic word processor for Linux. I
am trying to get an idea of how people use their word processors for writing
things such as newspaper articles, technical papers, works of fiction, blog
posts, etc.

If you could please answer the following questions, I would greatly appreciate
it.

## Q0. Occupation, Name, Age?

## Q1. When writing text on a computer, what tools do you usually use?

ex. Microsoft Word, WriteRoom, Wordpress Online Editor, Etherpad, Vim, etc. If
you use more than one, please specify what you use each for. 

## Q2. What environment do you usually write in?

ex. Coffee shop, well-lit room, dark alleyways, buses, anywhere I can sit, etc.

## Q3. What features do you find absolutly necessary when writting using a word processor?

ex. Word count, keyboard shortcuts, find and replace, spell check, formatting, etc.

## Q4. How large is the average piece of text you write?

ex. single pages, books, a few paragraphs, etc.

Thank you for your responses. If you'd like to learn more about my senior
