# Proposal Form

Senior Project with Dr. Turner  
Nathaniel Welch  
April 10th, 2010  

## 1. Definition of Senior Project.
 
A senior project is a project which lets a student take what they have learned
during their time at Cal Poly, and apply it to an idea that interests them. In
computer science, students often choose to build a piece of software, because
often in their studies they are focused only on certain topics and usually have
trouble producing something of value in under ten weeks. Cal Poly's
requirements for a senior project are loose, at best, basically requiring a
student to do something, by themselves or in a small group, that requires them
to be in charge and to know when to seek help.

The Computer Science department has slightly stricter requirements. Their
requirements say that a senior project must have "Technical accomplishment",
"Diligent execution", and "Effective communication". I agree with these three
requirements because they seem to encapsulate what a student should be when
they graduate from Cal Poly's distinguished computer science department. They
should be interested in challenging what they know and be willing to learn more
about our ever changing field on their own. CSC students should also be able to
manage their time between learning new things, creating new software,
maintaining their software, and everything else. Finally Computer Science
graduates should be able to communicate their successes, and failures, to those
who are both technically and non-technically oriented.

## 2. Type of Senior Project Proposed.
 
I would like to build a software system to help non-technical writers write
books on Linux.

## 3. Expected Abstract of Senior Project.

For my senior project I will be building a desktop application similar to
[WriteRoom][writeroom] and [OmmWriter][ommwriter]. These two applications are
both word processors for the Mac OS X operating system. They take are what is
commonly described as a reset on word processing software, bringing the
software back to the days of Microsoft Word 3.0 and Word Perfect. They do this
by spending more time on focusing on the design of the software interface, and
focusing on keeping it minimalistic, instead of filling the product with new
obscure features, which is an common complaint against the current iterations
of Microsoft Word.

## 4. Proposed Table of Contents.

 1. Abstract
 2. Introduction
 
    Describe the domain
 
 3. Problem description
 
    Where I carefully describe the problem I am interested in
 
 4. Survey of relevant work
 
    Research of the history of word processors, UI Design, and the written word.
 
 5. Your Contribution
 
    Consists of some (possibly small) variation on current solutions, a new
    synthesis or combination of solutions, an analytic criticism of some known
    solutions, a model to test some hypothesis about the solutions (software)
    or a mature description of open questions in the area
 
 6. Evaluation of contribution
 
    Where I explain how my work has meaning in some context. Should show some
    improvement over current solutions.

 7. Ethical implications of writting Open Source Software
 
 8. Conclusion, and Bibliography.
 
## 5. Proposed Process Model for Completion.

Here you must propose how you plan to carry out your project. It should include a timetable with proposed work schedule (timesheets are required: remember to expect 10 -- 15 hours per week to work on the project). It must show the synchronization points for evaluation of work (by you and by me.) The process model also needs to include features such as change management and alternative considerations (such as if your original idea totally fails.)

## 6. Senior Project Basic Requirements.

 I want this project to be sort of the antithesis of my time at Cal Poly. The
 computer science department is currently changing from a place built entirely
 around teaching people how to build desktop applications, to a place focused
 on the web and developing for it's concurrency based infrastructure. Most of
 my lower level classes were of the first school of thought, but almost all of
 my upper level classes have had me build web applications, and I also develop
 web applications professionally. Because of this, I would like to build a
 desktop application so I can truly understand the differences between the web
 and the desktop development cycle.

 The following are functional requirements for my project:

 * It must be Open Source
 * The language it is written in must be Open Source
 * It must run on Linux
 * It must run full screen

The following are non-functional requirements for my project:

 * It must promote a distraction free work environment.
 * It must be usable by people who work in various lighting environments (writing in a coffee shop, dark room, corporate environment)

## 7. Senior Project Test Plan.

You must have some idea how to tell when you are "done." You must also have some way to evaluate your work and your results so that you can manage your expectations for completion and for grade evaluation. A test plan will guide such an effort: it will be based on your Senior Project requirements. The test plan should include a proposed set of acceptance tests. It should also include a way to evaluate quality attributes and the resulting grade assignments you would think would be fair.

## 8. Resources List

 * Time with Dr. Turner (An hour every two weeks?)
 * A Ruby book (Obtained...)
 * A book on coding user interfaces with Ruby
 * Coffee
 * Beer
 * 10-15 hours a week to code
 * a GitHub account (Already have...)
 * Someone (Dr. Turner?) to talk to about open-source software licences.
 * Laptop, running Linux, with Ruby 1.9 and vim 7.2 installed (In possession)
