### WriteRoom

 * Lets you change font and colors
 * obscure key combinations to do any sort of display settings
 * ESC lets you turn app into normal text editor. Almost seems like a wrapper around text edit.
 * Growl notifications still appear
 * Wrap to page is pretty cool

### OmmWriter

 * Lets you change font (sans, serif, script), font-size, themes (background/color combinations), background music and typing noise
 * I found typing noise very soothing, but I prefered to pick my own background music.
 * very limited choice in themes. No Black/Green, low contrast option
 * the sound the program produced an emotion that seemed to promote typing, although I'm not sure if I could say it was distraction free.
 * UI was much more visible
 * gave scroll bar and word count
 * adjustable work area
