# UI Prototype

As my ideas for coffee_shops user interface grows, I will post my work here.

## UI Story Board Sketches

My initial sketches of the user interface contain four major elements. A list
of tabs on top of pages so the user can easily switch between current
projects, a simple five button expanding menu on the right, word count, page
count and current time at the bottom and finally the outline of the page.

Here are scanned versions of those sketches:
