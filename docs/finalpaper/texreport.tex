\begin{abstract}
My senior project was spent building a desktop application similar to WriteRoom and OmmWriter. These two applications are both word processors for the Macintosh OS X operating system. They take what is commonly described as a reset on word processing software, bringing the software back to the days of Microsoft Word 3.0 and Word Perfect. They do this by spending more time on focusing on the design of the software interface, and focusing on keeping it minimalistic, instead of filling the product with new obscure features, which is a common complaint against the current iterations of Microsoft Word.

The final application, named coffee\_shop, ended up not meeting my expectations. Having spent most of my education on developing applications for the internet, instead of the desktop, I ran into pitfalls which, if this had been an internet application wouldn't have been an issue.

\section{Introduction}

Depending on the job, people use different tools. Some are incredibly specialised, such as post hole diggers, others are much more generic, such as hammers. In the software world, historically tools have been built to be much more generic. Microsoft Word for example not only let you write documents, but also create spreadsheets, resumes and many other things. To fight this, certain programs have been created more recently to bring focus on specific tasks. examples....

\section{Problem description}

The problem coffee\_shop tries to attack is whether or not developing a desktop application focused on writing, instead of formating, is a good idea.
