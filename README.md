# coffee_shop

coffee_shop is the name for my senior project.

The source code for this project is available on [GitHub](http://github.com/icco/coffee_shop).

The general schedule for this project is writing a proposal and rough spec
4/29/10 through 6/11/10. Then coding the project August through December, and
turning in the final paper near the beginning of march.

## Who?

This project is being done by Nathaniel "Nat" Welch. You can find him at
various places:

 * <nat@natwelch.com>
 * <http://github.com/icco>
 * <http://natwelch.com>
 * on freenode.net as icco.

## What? 

You can read the entire proposal, but basically I am creating a distraction
free word processor for Linux.
