# coffee_shop

coffee shop is the name for my senior project.

For the next ten weeks or so this repository will contain mainly
documentation, and very little code, but that may change with time.

## Who?

This project is being done by Nathaniel "Nat" Welch. You can find him at various places:

 * on freenode.net as icco.
 * <nat@natwelch.com>
 * <http://github.com/icco>
 * <http://natwelch.com>

## What? 

You can read the entire proposal, but basically I am creating a WriteRoom clone for Linux.
