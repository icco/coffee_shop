# coffee_shop

coffee_shop is the name for my senior project.

For the next ten weeks or so this repository will contain mainly documentation,
and very little code, but that may change with time. The source code for this
project is available on [GitHub](http://github.com/icco/coffee_shop).

## Who?

This project is being done by Nathaniel "Nat" Welch. You can find him at various places:

 * on freenode.net as icco.
 * <nat@natwelch.com>
 * <http://github.com/icco>
 * <http://natwelch.com>

## What? 

You can read the entire proposal, but basically I am creating a WriteRoom clone for Linux.
