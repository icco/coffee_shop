# coffee_shop

coffee_shop is a distraction free Text Editor from Linux written in Ruby.

The source code for this project is available on [GitHub][gh].

This project has been essentially abandoned. You can read [my final paper][paper] for a description of my process creating this application and my final thoughts on it.

## Installation

Installation is pretty simple. You just need [Qt4][qt] and Ruby 1.8. I'll assume you know how to install ruby.

To install Qt4:

 * on Debian and Ubuntu: `sudo aptitude install libqt4-ruby`

Once you have Qt4 for Ruby install, just run `./coffee_shop.rb`.

## Documentation

A copy of the documentation is running at http://coffeeshop.heroku.com, but if you want to run a local copy, install the Ruby gems listed in .gems and run `docs/website.rb`.
